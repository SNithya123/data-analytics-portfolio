# 🏃‍♂️ Customer Profiling & Probability Analysis for FitGear Treadmills

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **descriptive statistics** and **probability analysis** on customer purchase data for **FitGear**, a fitness equipment company. The goal is to uncover patterns in customer demographics and buying behavior for different treadmill models. These insights help the company refine marketing strategies and make data-driven product recommendations.

## 📓 Project Notebook

You can view the complete analysis in the [Jupyter Notebook](FitGear_Case_Study.ipynb).


## 📊 Objective

To **build customer profiles** and **analyze purchasing probabilities** for each treadmill product line using statistical methods. The analysis includes:

- Understanding customer behavior based on age, gender, marital status, and income.
- Identifying which type of customer prefers which treadmill model.
- Computing **marginal** and **conditional probabilities**.
- Offering insights to enhance **targeted marketing** and **product placement**.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`  
- **Statistical Methods:** Descriptive statistics, Boxplots, Crosstabs, Probability calculation  
- **Visualization:** Countplots, Histograms, Boxplots, Heatmaps

---

## 🧪 Key Techniques Applied

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier detection using visual and statistical methods
- Visualization of customer demographics vs. product choice
- Crosstab-based **marginal & conditional probability** computation
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Examined data types and statistical summaries of each attribute.
- Visualized **distribution of age**, **income**, and **product purchases**.
- Segmented users by gender, marital status, and age groups.
- Identified outliers in age and income using boxplots and `.describe()`.

---

## 📈 Statistical Analysis & Probabilities

- Computed the **probability** of a male or female customer purchasing a specific treadmill model (e.g., KP281, KP481, KP781).
- Constructed **two-way contingency tables** to evaluate:
  - Impact of marital status on product choice
  - Age distribution among different product buyers
- Measured **correlation** between variables using a heatmap to explore multivariate relationships.

## 💡 Key Insights

1. 🧍‍♀️ **Younger female customers (aged 25-35)** are more likely to purchase the high-end **KP781** model.
2. 💰 Customers with higher income (above $70k) prefer **KP481** for its balance of features and cost.
3. 💑 Married individuals tend to buy **mid-tier models**, likely due to shared household decisions.
4. 🔢 **KP281** is the most frequently purchased treadmill among younger and budget-conscious customers.
5. 📊 Strong correlation between **age** and **income** indicates potential for targeted pricing strategies.

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- 🎯 Launch targeted ads for **KP781** on platforms with a young, urban female audience.
- 🛍️ Bundle KP281 with entry-level fitness accessories to boost value for new users.
- 🧓 Introduce loyalty offers for older buyers of KP481, who tend to have higher repeat purchase rates.
- 📈 Use probability scores to power **personalized product recommendation engines**.
