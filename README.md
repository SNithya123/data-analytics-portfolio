## 📁 Featured Projects

### 1. 🛒RetailCo E-Commerce Case Study (SQL – MySQL/BigQuery)
**Domain**: E-commerce | **Skills**: SQL, Time Series, Freight Analysis, Customer Behavior

Analyzed Brazil-based e-commerce data to uncover trends in customer orders, delivery patterns, and payment behavior across states and cities. Delivered insights on:

- Seasonal demand trends & time-of-day ordering patterns
- Delivery delays vs estimates, and freight cost variations
- Monthly order volumes & economic impact by state
- Popular payment types and installment usage

### 2. 🎬StreamFlix Content Strategy (Python – Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
**Domain**: OTT / Media | **Skills**: Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, Business Insights

Explored Streamflix’s global dataset to identify content trends by country, format (TV vs Movies), genres, and cast. Recommendations focus on:

- What kind of shows to produce more
- Which countries have genre-specific preferences
- Seasonal patterns in content launches

### 3. 🏃‍♂️ FitGear Customer Segmentation (Python – Stats & Probability)
**Domain**: Fitness / Retail | **Skills**: Descriptive Stats, Probability, Customer Profiling

Performed exploratory and probabilistic analysis to segment customers buying different types of treadmills (KP281, KP481, KP781). Work included:

- Marginal & conditional probability estimation
- Profiling customers by age, marital status, gender
- Visual analysis of categorical and numerical attributes

### 4. 🛍️ MegaMart – Gender-wise Spending & Confidence Intervals (Python – CLT & Stats)
**Domain**: Retail / Consumer Behavior | **Skills**: CLT, Hypothesis Testing, Confidence Intervals

Used the Central Limit Theorem to test whether women spend more than men during Black Friday, using sampled customer purchase data. Extended the analysis to:

- Married vs Unmarried spending patterns
- Spending differences across age groups
- Confidence interval interpretation for business decision-making

### 5. 🚲 CycleShare Co. Bike Demand Forecasting (Python – Hypothesis Testing)
**Domain**: Mobility / Rentals | **Skills**: T-test, ANOVA, Chi-square, EDA

Analyzed factors affecting demand for shared electric bikes using statistical hypothesis testing. Key questions explored:

- Do weekends have lower rental demand?
- Is weather or season impacting cycle rentals?
- Are predictors like working day, season, weather statistically independent?
