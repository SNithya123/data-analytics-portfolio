## üöÄ Project Overview

As a Data Analyst at XYZ, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of e-commerce data to uncover deep insights into customer behavior, order trends, and regional dynamics in Brazil. The goal was to enable data-driven decision-making to optimize operations, improve customer satisfaction, and boost revenue growth.

This project showcases my expertise in SQL (MySQL / BigQuery), data exploration, and deriving actionable business recommendations from complex datasets.

## üîç Key Insights from XYZ E-commerce Data Analysis

### 1. Strong and Consistent Growth in Orders
- The number of orders placed showed a steady upward trend year-over-year from 2016 through 2018.
- Monthly seasonality patterns revealed peak shopping periods aligning with holidays and promotional campaigns, suggesting timing marketing efforts can maximize sales impact.

### 2. Geographic Concentration of Customers
- The majority of orders originated from a handful of key Brazilian states such as S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.
- Urban centers had higher order volumes, indicating a potential focus area for localized marketing and logistics optimization.

### 3. Customer Ordering Time Preferences
- Brazilian customers predominantly placed orders during the afternoon and evening hours (13:00 - 23:00), with a noticeable dip during dawn hours.
- This behavior can guide customer service and delivery scheduling to improve customer experience.

### 4. Delivery Efficiency & Opportunities
- Delivery times varied significantly by state, with some states consistently beating estimated delivery times while others lagged behind.
- Top 5 fastest delivery states outperformed estimates by an average of 2 days, highlighting best practices that can be scaled.
- Conversely, states with longer delivery times represent opportunities for operational improvements.

### 5. Freight Cost Variability
- Freight costs fluctuated considerably across regions; top 5 states had freight costs nearly 30% higher than the lowest 5 states.
- This suggests potential for renegotiating logistics contracts or exploring alternate shipping methods in high-cost regions.

### 6. Economic Impact & Payment Behavior
- Payment values increased by approximately 12% from Jan-Aug 2017 to the same period in 2018, indicating growing customer spend and potential inflationary effects.
- Payment methods showed a strong preference for credit card transactions, with installment-based payments accounting for over 40% of orders.
- Understanding installment trends allows the finance team to tailor payment plans and improve customer retention.

## üéØ Actionable Recommendations

- **Target Marketing During Peak Months:** Plan campaigns aligned with monthly order seasonality to maximize customer engagement.
- **Focus Logistics Improvements:** Prioritize operational audits in states with slower deliveries and high freight costs.
- **Optimize Delivery Scheduling:** Align delivery fleet availability with peak order times in the afternoon and evening.
- **Expand Installment Payment Options:** Encourage installment plans as they are popular and could increase average order value.
- **Regional Promotions:** Launch localized offers in high-volume cities and states to further capture market share.
